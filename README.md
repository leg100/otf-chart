Autogenerated from chart metadata using [helm-docs v1.11.3](https://github.com/norwoodj/helm-docs/releases/v1.11.3)

## Development

If you make any changes to the chart you need to bump its version. You can either do that by hand in `Chart.yaml`, or using `make`:

```bash
# requires `yq`
make bump
```

To generate the `README.md` from its template, `README.md.gotmpl`:

```bash
# requires `helm-docs`
make readme
```

Any changes to the version or to the `values.yaml` file are automatically reflected in the generated `README.md`.

To lint the chart:

```bash
make lint
```

To deploy the chart to a cluster to the namespace `otf-test` with pre-configured defaults along with PostgreSQL:

```bash
make deploy
```

To test the chart (assumes release is named `otf`):

```bash
make test
```

And to lint, deploy, and then test the chart:

```bash
make all
```
